Description:
1. I chose Python because I want to work on data science projects later. I picked Django framework because I think this is one of the most comprehensive and commonly used framework with Python.
2. This app idea stems from my personal interest in crypto, and I think that the functions we take for granted everyday with crypto exchange apps are sufficiently complex and has sufficient scope for me to practice coding on.
3. I want to work with API as I think this is a very useful skill to have, being able to integrate data from other sources.
4. I used bootstrap to help me with basic design which is not the focus for this project. Nevertheless, the design provided is sufficient for me to design a reasonable layout that is understandable by a user, albeit not as pretty.
